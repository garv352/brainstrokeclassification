# Objective:

A stroke occurs when a blood vessel in the brain ruptures and bleeds, or when there’s a blockage in the blood supply to the brain. The rupture or blockage prevents blood and oxygen from reaching the brain’s tissues. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), stroke is a leading cause of death in the United States. Every year, more than 795,000 U.S. people have a stroke. Without oxygen, brain cells and tissue become damaged and begin to die within minutes.

#  Method and data used:

We have used the brain stroke data which has various data points like gender, age, BMI, residence_type, heart disease etc. We use these data points to create a classification algorithm that determines whether a person is likely to experience a brain stroke. We have over 4000 data points in this dataset file.

In order to determine it, we used the K nearest neighbour algorithm.
